            Represents a single entry in a ZipFile. Typically, applications get a ZipEntry
            by enumerating the entries within a ZipFile, or by adding an entry to a ZipFile.

      <remarks>
        <para>
               This method is called in prep for reading the source stream.  If PKZIP
               encryption is used, then we need to calc the CRC32 before doing the
               encryption, because the CRC is used in the 12th byte of the PKZIP
               encryption header.  So, we need to be able to seek backward in the source
               when saving the ZipEntry. This method is called from the place that
               calculates the CRC, and also from the method that does the encryption of
               the file data.
             </para>
        <para>
               The first time through, this method sets the _sourceStreamOriginalPosition

      <summary>
            Copy metadata that may have been changed by the app.  We do this when
            resetting the zipFile instance.  If the app calls Save() on a ZipFile, then
            tries to party on that file some more, we may need to Reset() it , which
            means re-reading the entries and then copying the metadata.  I think.

            Set the input stream and get its length, if possible.  The
            length is used for progress updates, AND, to allow an
            optimization in case of a stream/file of zero length. In
            that case we skip the Encrypt and DeflateStream.

               When adding an entry from a file or directory, the Creation, Access, and
               Modified times for the given entry are automatically set from the
               filesystem values. When adding an entry from a stream or string, the
               values are implicitly set to DateTime.Now.  The application may wish to
               set these values to some arbitrary value, before saving the archive, and
               can do so using the various setters.  If you want to set all of the times,
               this method is more efficient.

        <para>
             DotNetZip offers a variety of ways to extract entries from a zip file.  This
             method allows an application to extract and entry by reading a Stream.
             </para>
        <para>
             The return value is a <see cref="T:Ionic.Zlib.CrcCalculatorStream" />.  Use it
             as you would any stream for reading.  The data you get by calling <see cref="M:System.IO.Stream.Read(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)" /> on that stream will be decrypted and
             decompressed.
             </para>
        <para>
             CrcCalculatorStream adds one additional feature: it keeps a CRC32 checksum
             on the bytes of the stream as it is read.  The CRC value is available in the
             <see cref="P:Ionic.Zlib.CrcCalculatorStream.Crc" /> property on the
             <c>CrcCalculatorStream</c>.  When the read is complete, this CRC
             <em>should</em> be checked against the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Crc" /> property
             on the <c>ZipEntry</c> to validate the content of the ZipEntry.  You don't
             have to validate the entry using the CRC, but you should. Check the example
             for how to do this.
             </para>
        <para>
             If the entry is protected with a password, then you need to provide a
             password prior to calling <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.OpenReader" />, either by setting the
             <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Password" /> property on the entry, or the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Password" /> property on the <c>ZipFile</c> itself. Or, you can
             use <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.OpenReader(System.String)" />, the overload of OpenReader that
             accepts a password parameter.
             </para>
        <para>
             If you want to extract entry data into a stream that is already opened, like
             a <see cref="T:System.IO.FileStream" />, consider the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Extract(System.IO.Stream)" /> method.

      <example>
             This example shows how to open a zip archive, then read in a named entry via
             a stream.  After the read loop is complete, the code compares the calculated
             during the read loop with the expected CRC on the <c>ZipEntry</c>, to verify
             the extraction.

        <para>
               In a nutshell: Daylight savings time rules change regularly.  In 2007, for
               example, the inception week of DST changed.  In 1977, DST was in place all
               year round. In 1945, likewise.  And so on.  Win32 does not attempt to
               guess which time zone rules were in effect at the time in question.  It
               will render a time as "standard time" and allow the app to change to DST
               as necessary.  .NET makes a different choice.
             </para>
        <para>
               Compare the output of FileInfo.LastWriteTime.ToString("f") with what you
               see in the Windows Explorer property sheet for a file that was last
               written to on the other side of the DST transition. For example, suppose
               the file was last modified on October 17, 2003, during DST but DST is not
               currently in effect. Explorer's file properties reports Thursday, October
               17, 2003, 8:45:38 AM, but .NETs FileInfo reports Thursday, October 17,
               2003, 9:45 AM.
             </para>
        <para>
               Win32 says, "Thursday, October 17, 2002 8:45:38 AM PST". Note: Pacific
               STANDARD Time. Even though October 17 of that year occurred during Pacific
               Daylight Time, Win32 displays the time as standard time because that's
               what time it is NOW.
             </para>
        <para>
               .NET BCL assumes that the current DST rules were in place at the time in
               question.  So, .NET says, "Well, if the rules in effect now were also in
               effect on October 17, 2003, then that would be daylight time" so it
               displays "Thursday, October 17, 2003, 9:45 AM PDT" - daylight time.
             </para>
        <para>
               So .NET gives a value which is more intuitively correct, but is also
               potentially incorrect, and which is not invertible. Win32 gives a value
               which is intuitively incorrect, but is strictly correct.
             </para>
        <para>
               Because of this funkiness, this library adds one hour to the LastModified
               time on the extracted file, if necessary.  That is to say, if the time in
               question had occurred in what the .NET Base Class Library assumed to be
               DST. This assumption may be wrong given the constantly changing DST rules,
               but it is the best we can do.

        <para>
               Let me explain. It's going to take a while, so get
               comfortable. Originally, waaaaay back in 1989 when the ZIP specification
               was originally described by the esteemed Mr. Phil Katz, the dominant
               operating system of the time was MS-DOS. MSDOS stored file times with a
               2-second precision, because, c'mon, <em>who is ever going to need better
               resolution than THAT?</em> And so ZIP files, regardless of the platform on
               which the zip file was created, store file times in exactly <see href="http://www.vsft.com/hal/dostime.htm">the same format that DOS used
               in 1989</see>.
             </para>
        <para>
               Since then, the ZIP spec has evolved, but the internal format for file
               timestamps remains the same.  Despite the fact that the way times are
               stored in a zip file is rooted in DOS heritage, any program on any
               operating system can format a time in this way, and most zip tools and
               libraries DO - they round file times to the nearest even second and store
               it just like DOS did 25+ years ago.
             </para>
        <para>
               PKWare extended the ZIP specification to allow a zip file to store what
               are called "NTFS Times" and "Unix(tm) times" for a file.  These are the
               <em>last write</em>, <em>last access</em>, and <em>file creation</em>
               times of a particular file. These metadata are not actually specific to
               NTFS or Unix. They are tracked for each file by NTFS and by various Unix
               filesystems, but they are also tracked by other filesystems, too.  The key
               point is that the times are <em>formatted in the zip file</em> in the same
               way that NTFS formats the time (ticks since win32 epoch), or in the same
               way that Unix formats the time (seconds since Unix epoch).
             </para>
        <para>
               These extended times are higher precision quantities than the DOS time.
               As described above, the (DOS) LastModified has a precision of 2 seconds.
               The Unix time is stored with a precision of 1 second. The NTFS time is
               stored with a precision of 0.0000001 seconds. The quantities are easily
               convertible, except for the loss of precision you may incur.
             </para>
        <para>
               A zip archive can store the {C,A,M} times in NTFS format, in Unix format,
               or not at all.  Often a tool running on Unix or Mac will embed the times
               in Unix format (1 second precision), while WinZip running on Windows might
               embed the times in NTFS format (precision of of 0.0000001 seconds).  When
               reading a zip file with these "extended" times, in either format,
               DotNetZip represents the values with the
               <c>ModifiedTime</c>, <c>AccessedTime</c> and <c>CreationTime</c>
               properties on the <c>ZipEntry</c>.
             </para>
        <para>
               As with the DOS time, any tool or library running on any operating system
               is capable of formatting a time in one of these ways and embedding it into
               the zip file. The key is, not all zip tools or libraries support all these
               formats.  Storing the higher-precision times for each entry is optional
               for zip files, and many tools and libraries don't use the higher precision
               quantities at all, though it is much nicer than the DOS time.  And futher,
               there are also cases where the timestamp of the file entry is not known,
               and is not stored. For example, this happens when content for the entry is
               obtained from a stream.  The bottom line is that the higher-resolution
               times, in either format, are not guaranteed to be present for a ZipEntry.
               The old DOS time, represented by <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.LastModified" />, is guaranteed
               to be present, though it sometimes unset.
             </para>
        <para>
               Ok, getting back to the question about how the <c>LastModified</c>
               property relates to this <c>ModifiedTime</c>
               property... <c>LastModified</c> is always set, while <c>ModifiedTime</c>
               is not. (The other times stored in the <em>NTFS times extension</em>,
               <c>CreationTime</c> and <c>AccessedTime</c> also may not be set on an
               entry that is read from an existing zip file.) When reading a zip file,
               then <c>LastModified</c> takes the DOS time that is stored with the
               file. If the DOS time has been stored as zero in the zipfile, then this
               library will use <c>DateTime.Now</c> for the <c>LastModified</c> value.
               If the ZIP file was created by an evolved tool, then there will also be
               NTFS times in the zip file.  In that case, this library will read those
               times, and set <c>LastModified</c> and <c>ModifiedTime</c> to the same
               value, the one corresponding to the last write time of the file.  If there
               are no "NTFS times" stored for the entry, then <c>ModifiedTime</c> remains
               unset (likewise <c>AccessedTime</c> and <c>CreationTime</c>), and
               <c>LastModified</c> keeps its DOS time.
             </para>
        <para>
               When creating zip files with this library, by default the extended time
               properties (<c>ModifiedTime</c>, <c>AccessedTime</c>, and
               <c>CreationTime</c>) are set on the ZipEntry instance, and these data are
               stored in the zip archive for each entry, in NTFS format. If you add an
               entry from an actual filesystem file, then the entry gets the actual file
               times for that file, to NTFS-level precision.  If you add an entry from a
               stream, or a string, then the times get the value <c>DateTime.Now</c>.  In
               this case <c>LastModified</c> and <c>ModifiedTime</c> will be identical,
               to 2 seconds of precision.  You can explicitly set the
               <c>CreationTime</c>, <c>AccessedTime</c>, and <c>ModifiedTime</c> of an
               entry using the property setters.  If you want to set all of those
               quantities, it's more efficient to use the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.SetEntryTimes(System.DateTime,System.DateTime,System.DateTime)" /> method.  Those
               changes are not made permanent in the zip file until you call <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save" /> or one of its cousins.
             </para>
        <para>
               When creating a zip file, you can override the default behavior for
               formatting times in the zip file, disabling the embedding of file times in
               NTFS format or enabling the storage of file times in Unix format, or both.
               You may want to do this, for example, when creating a zip file on Windows,
               that will be consumed on a Mac, by an application that is not hip to the
               "NTFS times" format. To do this, use the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.EmitTimesInWindowsFormatWhenSaving" /> and <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.EmitTimesInUnixFormatWhenSaving" /> properties.  A valid zip file may
               store the file times in both formats.  But, there are no guarantees that a
               program running on Mac or Linux will gracefully handle the NTFS Formatted
               times, or that a non-DotNetZip-powered application running on Windows will
               be able to handle file times in Unix format. When in doubt, test.

               adding an entry from the filesystem.  When adding an entry from a stream
               or string, the Attributes are not set implicitly.  Regardless of the way
               an entry was added to a <c>ZipFile</c>, you can set the attributes
               explicitly if you like.

        <para>
               When reading a <c>ZipEntry</c> from a <c>ZipFile</c>, the attributes are
               set according to the data stored in the <c>ZipFile</c>. If you extract the
               entry from the archive to a filesystem file, DotNetZip will set the
               attributes on the resulting file accordingly.
             </para>
        <para>
               The attributes can be set explicitly by the application.  For example the
               application may wish to set the <c>FileAttributes.ReadOnly</c> bit for all
               entries added to an archive, so that on unpack, this attribute will be set
               on the extracted file.  Any changes you make to this property are made
               permanent only when you call a <c>Save()</c> method on the <c>ZipFile</c>
               instance that contains the ZipEntry.
             </para>
        <para>
               For example, an application may wish to zip up a directory and set the
               ReadOnly bit on every file in the archive, so that upon later extraction,
               the resulting files will be marked as ReadOnly.  Not every extraction tool
               respects these attributes, but if you unpack with DotNetZip, as for
               example in a self-extracting archive, then the attributes will be set as
               they are stored in the <c>ZipFile</c>.

        <para>
               These attributes may not be interesting or useful if the resulting archive

      <remarks>
        <para>
               The application can use this property to set the input stream for an
               entry on a just-in-time basis. Imagine a scenario where the application
               creates a <c>ZipFile</c> comprised of content obtained from hundreds of
               files, via calls to <c>AddFile()</c>. The DotNetZip library opens streams
               on these files on a just-in-time basis, only when writing the entry out to
               an external store within the scope of a <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> call.  Only
               one input stream is opened at a time, as each entry is being written out.
             </para>
        <para>
               Now imagine a different application that creates a <c>ZipFile</c>
               with content obtained from hundreds of streams, added through <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddEntry(System.String,System.IO.Stream)" />.  Normally the
               application would supply an open stream to that call.  But when large
               numbers of streams are being added, this can mean many open streams at one
               time, unnecessarily.
             </para>
        <para>
               To avoid this, call <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddEntry(System.String,Ionic.Zip.OpenDelegate,Ionic.Zip.CloseDelegate)" /> and specify delegates that open and close the stream at

      <remarks>
        <para>
               When creating a zip archive, an application can obtain content for one or
               more of the <c>ZipEntry</c> instances from streams, using the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddEntry(System.String,System.IO.Stream)" /> method.  At the time
               of calling that method, the application can supply null as the value of
               the stream parameter.  By doing so, the application indicates to the
               library that it will provide a stream for the entry on a just-in-time
               basis, at the time one of the <c>ZipFile.Save()</c> methods is called and
               the data for the various entries are being compressed and written out.
             </para>
        <para>
               In this case, the application can set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.InputStream" />
               property, typically within the SaveProgress event (event type: <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipProgressEventType.Saving_BeforeWriteEntry" />) for that entry.
             </para>
        <para>
               The application will later want to call Close() and Dispose() on that
               stream.  In the SaveProgress event, when the event type is <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.ZipProgressEventType.Saving_AfterWriteEntry" />, the application can
               do so.  This flag indicates that the stream has been provided by the
               application on a just-in-time basis and that it is the application's
               responsibility to call Close/Dispose on that stream.

               The Zip specification from PKWare defines a set of encryption algorithms,
               and the data formats for the zip archive that support them, and PKWare
               supports those algorithms in the tools it produces. Other vendors of tools
               and libraries, such as WinZip or Xceed, typically support <em>a
               subset</em> of the algorithms specified by PKWare. These tools can
               sometimes support additional different encryption algorithms and data
               formats, not specified by PKWare. The AES Encryption specified and
               supported by WinZip is the most popular example. This library supports a
               subset of the complete set of algorithms specified by PKWare and other
               vendors.

               There is no common, ubiquitous multi-vendor standard for strong encryption
               within zip files. There is broad support for so-called "traditional" Zip
               encryption, sometimes called Zip 2.0 encryption, as <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">specified
               by PKWare</see>, but this encryption is considered weak and
               breakable. This library currently supports the Zip 2.0 "weak" encryption,
               and also a stronger WinZip-compatible AES encryption, using either 128-bit
               or 256-bit key strength. If you want DotNetZip to support an algorithm
               that is not currently supported, call the author of this library and maybe
               we can talk business.

               The <see cref="T:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile" /> class also has a <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Encryption" /> property.  In most cases you will use
               <em>that</em> property when setting encryption. This property takes
               precedence over any <c>Encryption</c> set on the <c>ZipFile</c> itself.
               Typically, you would use the per-entry Encryption when most entries in the
               zip archive use one encryption algorithm, and a few entries use a
               different one.  If all entries in the zip file use the same Encryption,
               then it is simpler to just set this property on the ZipFile itself, when
               creating a zip archive.

        <para>
               Some comments on updating archives: If you read a <c>ZipFile</c>, you can
               modify the Encryption on an encrypted entry: you can remove encryption
               from an entry that was encrypted; you can encrypt an entry that was not
               encrypted previously; or, you can change the encryption algorithm.  The
               changes in encryption are not made permanent until you call Save() on the
               <c>ZipFile</c>.  To effect changes in encryption, the entry content is
               streamed through several transformations, depending on the modification
               the application has requested. For example if the entry is not encrypted
               and the application sets <c>Encryption</c> to <c>PkzipWeak</c>, then at
               the time of <c>Save()</c>, the original entry is read and decompressed,
               then re-compressed and encrypted.  Conversely, if the original entry is
               encrypted with <c>PkzipWeak</c> encryption, and the application sets the
               <c>Encryption</c> property to <c>WinZipAes128</c>, then at the time of
               <c>Save()</c>, the original entry is decrypted via PKZIP encryption and
               decompressed, then re-compressed and re-encrypted with AES.  This all
               happens automatically within the library, but it can be time-consuming for
               large entries.
             </para>
        <para>
               Additionally, when updating archives, it is not possible to change the
               password when changing the encryption algorithm.  To change both the
               algorithm and the password, you need to Save() the zipfile twice.  First
               set the <c>Encryption</c> to None, then call <c>Save()</c>.  Then set the
               <c>Encryption</c> to the new value (not "None"), then call <c>Save()</c>

               Consider setting the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Encryption" /> property when using a
               password. Answering concerns that the standard password protection
               supported by all zip tools is weak, WinZip has extended the ZIP
               specification with a way to use AES Encryption to protect entries in the
               Zip file. Unlike the "PKZIP 2.0" encryption specified in the PKZIP
               specification, <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES
               Encryption</see> uses a standard, strong, tested, encryption
               algorithm. DotNetZip can create zip archives that use WinZip-compatible
               AES encryption, if you set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Encryption" /> property. But,
               archives created that use AES encryption may not be readable by all other
               tools and libraries. For example, Windows Explorer cannot read a

               property.  This property takes precedence over any password set on the
               ZipFile itself.  Typically, you would use the per-entry Password when most
               entries in the zip archive use one password, and a few entries use a
               different password.  If all entries in the zip file use the same password,
               then it is simpler to just set this property on the ZipFile itself,
               whether creating a zip archive or extracting a zip archive.

               Some comments on updating archives: If you read a <c>ZipFile</c>, you
               cannot modify the password on any encrypted entry, except by extracting
               the entry with the original password (if any), removing the original entry
               via <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.RemoveEntry(Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry)" />, and then adding a new
               entry with a new Password.

        <para>
               For example, suppose you read a <c>ZipFile</c>, and there is an encrypted
               entry.  Setting the Password property on that <c>ZipEntry</c> and then
               calling <c>Save()</c> on the <c>ZipFile</c> does not update the password
               on that entry in the archive.  Neither is an exception thrown. Instead,
               what happens during the <c>Save()</c> is the existing entry is copied
               through to the new zip archive, in its original encrypted form. Upon
               re-reading that archive, the entry can be decrypted with its original
               password.

        <para>
               If you read a ZipFile, and there is an un-encrypted entry, you can set the

               encryption on that entry.

        <para>
               This is a long and odd name for a property, but there's a good reason for

               specification from PKWare</see>, filenames and comments for a
               <c>ZipEntry</c> are encoded either with IBM437 or with UTF8.  But, some
               zip archiver tools or libraries do not follow the specification, and
               instead encode characters using the system default code page, or an
               arbitrary code page.  For example, WinRAR when run on a machine in
               Shanghai may encode filenames with the Chinese (Big-5) code page.  This
               behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but it occurs anyway.  This
               property exists to support that non-compliant behavior when reading or
               writing zip files.
             </para>
        <para>
               When writing zip archives that will be read by one of these other
               archivers, use this property to specify the code page to use when encoding
               filenames and comments into the zip file, when the IBM437 code page will
               not suffice.
             </para>
        <para>
               Be aware that a zip file created after you've explicitly specified the
               code page will not be compliant to the PKWare specification, and may not
               be readable by compliant archivers.  On the other hand, many archivers are
               non-compliant and can read zip files created in arbitrary code pages. For
               example, if you run WinRar on your PC desktop in Kyoto, Japan, you will
               probably be able to open zip files that we encoded by DotNetZip in the
               Shift_JIS code page.
             </para>
        <para>
               When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no
               standard way for the creator (DotNetZip) to specify in the zip file which
               code page has been used. DotNetZip is not able to inspect the zip file and
               determine the codepage used for the entries within it. Therefore, you, the
               application author, must determine that.  If you read a zip file using a
               codepage other than the one used to encode the zipfile, this may result in
               filenames that are not legal in the filesystem, and you will get
               exceptions during calls to <c>Extract()</c> methods for those entries.

        <para>
               The <c>ZipFile</c> instance is written to storage - typically a zip file

        <para>
               Use this method to save the zip content to a stream directly.  A common
               scenario is an ASP.NET application that dynamically generates a zip file
               and allows the browser to download it. The application can call
               <c>Save(Response.OutputStream)</c> to write a zipfile directly to the
               output stream, without creating a zip file on the disk on the ASP.NET
               server.
             </para>
        <para>
               Be careful when saving a file to a non-seekable stream, including
               <c>Response.OutputStream</c>. When DotNetZip writes to a non-seekable
               stream, the zip archive is formatted in such a way that may not be
               compatible with all zip tools on all platforms.  It's a perfectly legal
               and compliant zip file, but some people have reported problems opening
               files produced this way using the Mac OS archive utility.

        <para>
             If an extraction of a file from the zip archive would overwrite an existing
             file in the filesystem, the action taken is dictated by the
             ExtractExistingFile property, which overrides any setting you may have made
             on individual ZipEntry instances.  By default, if you have not set that
             property on the <c>ZipFile</c> instance, the entry will not be extracted,
             the existing file will not be overwritten and an exception will be
             thrown. To change this, set the property, or use the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ExtractAll(System.String,Ionic.Zip.ExtractExistingFileAction)" />
             overload that allows you to specify an ExtractExistingFileAction parameter.

        <para>
             The action to take when an extract would overwrite an existing file applies
             to all entries.  If you want to set this on a per-entry basis, then you must

             About Timestamps: When extracting a file entry from a zip archive, the
             extracted file gets the last modified time of the entry as stored in the
             archive. The archive may also store extended file timestamp information,
             including last accessed and created times. If these are present in the
             <c>ZipEntry</c>, then the extracted file will also get these times.
             </para>
        <para>
             A Directory entry is somewhat different. It will get the times as described
             for a file entry, but, if there are file entries in the zip archive that,
             when extracted, appear in the just-created directory, then when those file
             entries are extracted, the last modified and last accessed times of the
             directory will change, as a side effect.  The result is that after an
             extraction of a directory and a number of files within the directory, the
             last modified and last accessed timestamps on the directory will reflect the
             time that the last file was extracted into the directory, rather than the
             time stored in the zip archive for the directory.
             </para>
        <para>
             To compensate, when extracting an archive with <c>ExtractAll</c>, DotNetZip
             will extract all the file and directory entries as described above, but it
             will then make a second pass on the directories, and reset the times on the
             directories to reflect what is stored in the zip archive.
             </para>
        <para>
             This compensation is performed only within the context of an
             <c>ExtractAll</c>. If you call <c>ZipEntry.Extract</c> on a directory entry,
             the timestamps on directory in the filesystem will reflect the times stored
             in the zip.  If you then call <c>ZipEntry.Extract</c> on a file entry, which
             is extracted into the directory, the timestamps on the directory will be
             updated to the current time.

               This method is handy if you are adding things to zip archive and don't
               want to bother distinguishing between directories or files.  Any files are
               added as single entries.  A directory added through this method is added
               recursively: all files and subdirectories contained within the directory
               are added to the <c>ZipFile</c>.

               to the disk only when you call <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save" /> or a similar
               save method.

               This example shows how to zip up a set of files into a flat hierarchy,
               regardless of where in the filesystem the files originated. The resulting
               zip archive will contain a toplevel directory named "flat", which itself
               will contain files Readme.txt, MyProposal.docx, and Image1.jpg.  A
               subdirectory under "flat" called SupportFiles will contain all the files
               in the "c:\SupportFiles" directory on disk.

               NB: With PKZip encryption, it's necessary to compute the CRC before
               compressing or encrypting the data.  Therefore, when using PKZip
               encryption with a WriteDelegate, the WriteDelegate will be called twice:
               once to compute the CRC, and the second time to (potentially) compress and
               encrypt. For each call of the delegate, your application must stream the
               same entry data in its entirety. If your application writes different data
               during the second call, it will result in a corrupt zip file.

      <example>
            
             This example uses a named delegate in VB to write data for the given
             ZipEntry (VB9 does not have anonymous delegates). The example here is a bit
             contrived - a simpler way to add the contents of a file to a ZipEntry is to
             simply use the appropriate <c>AddFile()</c> method.  The key scenario for
             which the <c>WriteDelegate</c> makes sense is saving a DataSet, in XML
             format, to the zip file. The DataSet can write XML to a stream, and the
             WriteDelegate is the perfect place to write into the zip file.  There may be
             other data structures that can write to a stream, but cannot be read as a
             stream.  The <c>WriteDelegate</c> would be appropriate for those cases as
             well.

               You will probably not need to do this in your code. One of the only times
               you will want to do this is if you want an empty directory in the zip
               archive.  The reason: if you add a file to a zip archive that is stored
               within a multi-level directory, all of the directory tree is implicitly
               created in the zip archive.

               This method selects files from the the current working directory matching
               the specified criteria, and adds them to the ZipFile.  The selection does
               not recurse into subdirectories.
             </para>
        <para>
               Specify the criteria in statements of 3 elements: a noun, an operator, and
               a value.  Consider the string "name != *.doc" .  The noun is "name".  The
               operator is "!=", implying "Not Equal".  The value is "*.doc".  That
               criterion, in English, says "all files with a name that does not end in
               the .doc extension."
             </para>
        <para>
               Supported nouns include "name" for the filename; "atime", "mtime", and
               "ctime" for last access time, last modfied time, and created time of the
               file, respectively; "attributes" for the file attributes; and "size" for
               the file length (uncompressed).  The "attributes" and "name" nouns both
               support = and != as operators.  The "size", "atime", "mtime", and "ctime"
               nouns support = and !=, and &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;= as well. The times
               are taken to be expressed in "local time".
             </para>
        <para>
               Specify values for the file attributes as a string with one or more of the
               characters H,R,S,A in any order, implying Hidden, ReadOnly, System, and
               Archive, respectively.  To specify a time, use YYYY-MM-DD-HH:mm:ss as the
               format.  If you omit the HH:mm:ss portion, it is assumed to be 00:00:00
               (midnight). The value for a size criterion is expressed in integer
               quantities of bytes, kilobytes (use k or kb after the number), megabytes
               (m or mb), or gigabytes (g or gb).  The value for a name is a pattern to
               match against the filename, potentially including wildcards.  The pattern
               follows CMD.exe glob rules: * implies one or more of any character (not
               including dot), while ? implies one character (not including dot).  If the
               name pattern contains any slashes, it is matched to the entire filename,
               including the path; otherwise, it is matched against only the filename
               without the path.  This means a pattern of "*\*.*" matches all files one
               directory level deep, while a pattern of "*.*" matches all files in all
               directories.
             </para>
        <para>
               To specify a name pattern that includes spaces, use single quotes around
               the pattern.  A pattern of "'* *.*'" will match all files that have spaces
               in the filename.  The full criteria string for that would be "name = '*
               *.*'" .

             You can combine criteria with the conjunctions AND or OR. Using a string like "name
             = *.txt AND size &gt;= 100k" for the selectionCriteria retrieves entries whose names
             end in  .txt, and whose uncompressed size is greater than or equal to
             100 kilobytes.
             </para>
        <para>
             For more complex combinations of criteria, you can use parenthesis to group clauses
             in the boolean logic.  Without parenthesis, the precedence of the criterion atoms is
             determined by order of appearance.  Unlike the C# language, the AND conjunction does
             not take precendence over the logical OR.  This is important only in strings that
             contain 3 or more criterion atoms.  In other words, "name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000
             or attributes = H" implies "((name = *.txt AND size &gt; 1000) OR attributes = H)"
             while "attributes = H OR name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000" evaluates to "((attributes
             = H OR name = *.txt) AND size &gt; 1000)".  When in doubt, use parenthesis.
             </para>
        <para>
             Using time properties requires some extra care. If you want to retrieve all entries
             that were last updated on 2009 February 14, specify a time range like so:"mtime
             &gt;= 2009-02-14 AND mtime &lt; 2009-02-15".  Read this to say: all files updated
             after 12:00am on February 14th, until 12:00am on February 15th.  You can use the
             same bracketing approach to specify any time period - a year, a month, a week, and
             so on.
             </para>
        <para>
             The syntax allows one special case: if you provide a string with no spaces, it is
             treated as a pattern to match for the filename.  Therefore a string like "*.xls"
             will be equivalent to specifying "name = *.xls".
             </para>
        <para>
             There is no logic in this method that insures that the file inclusion criteria are
             internally consistent.  For example, it's possible to specify criteria that says
             the file must have a size of less than 100 bytes, as well as a size that is
             greater than 1000 bytes. Obviously no file will ever satisfy such criteria, but
             this method does not detect such logical inconsistencies. The caller is
             responsible for insuring the criteria are sensible.

               To create a new zip archive, an application can call this constructor,
               passing the name of a file that does not exist.  The name may be a fully
               qualified path. Then the application can add directories or files to the
               <c>ZipFile</c> via <c>AddDirectory()</c>, <c>AddFile()</c>, <c>AddItem()</c>
               and then write the zip archive to the disk by calling <c>Save()</c>. The
               zip file is not actually opened and written to the disk until the
               application calls <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>.  At that point the new zip file
               with the given name is created.
             </para>
        <para>
               If you won't know the name of the <c>Zipfile</c> until the time you call
               <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>, or if you plan to save to a stream (which has no
               name), then you should use the no-argument constructor.

        <para>
               The application can also call this constructor to read an existing zip
               archive.  passing the name of a valid zip file that does exist. But, it's
               better form to use the static <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Read(System.String)" /> method,
               passing the name of the zip file, because using <c>ZipFile.Read()</c> in
               your code communicates very clearly what you are doing.  In either case,
               the file is then read into the <c>ZipFile</c> instance.  The app can then
               enumerate the entries or can modify the zip file, for example adding
               entries, removing entries, changing comments, and so on.

               One advantage to this parameterized constructor: it allows applications to

               This method is primarily useful from COM Automation environments, when

               update a zip file by using the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.#ctor">default (no argument)

             This example shows how to read a zip file using the Big-5 Chinese code page
             (950), and extract each entry in the zip file.  For this code to work as
             desired, the zipfile must have been created using the big5 code page
             (CP950). This is typical, for example, when using WinRar on a machine with
             CP950 set as the default code page.  In that case, the names of entries
             within the Zip archive will be stored in that code page, and reading the zip
             archive must be done using that code page.  If the application did not use
             the correct code page in ZipFile.Read(), then names of entries within the
             zip archive would not be correctly retrieved.

      <remarks>
        <para>
               First, let me say that you really don't need to bother with this.  It is
               here to allow for optimizations that you probably won't make! It will work
               fine if you don't set or get this property at all. Ok?
             </para>
        <para>
               Now that we have <em>that</em> out of the way, the fine print: This
               property affects the size of the buffer that is used for I/O for each
               entry contained in the zip file. When a file is read in to be compressed,
               it uses a buffer given by the size here.  When you update a zip file, the
               data for unmodified entries is copied from the first zip file to the
               other, through a buffer given by the size here.
             </para>
        <para>
               Changing the buffer size affects a few things: first, for larger buffer
               sizes, the memory used by the <c>ZipFile</c>, obviously, will be larger
               during I/O operations.  This may make operations faster for very much
               larger files.  Last, for any given entry, when you use a larger buffer
               there will be fewer progress events during I/O operations, because there's
               one progress event generated for each time the buffer is filled and then
               emptied.
             </para>
        <para>
               The default buffer size is 8k.  Increasing the buffer size may speed
               things up as you compress larger files.  But there are no hard-and-fast
               rules here, eh?  You won't know til you test it.  And there will be a
               limit where ever larger buffers actually slow things down.  So as I said
               in the beginning, it's probably best if you don't set or get this property
               at all.
             </para>
      </remarks>
      <example>
             This example shows how you might set a large buffer size for efficiency when
             dealing with zip entries that are larger than 1gb.

             using (ZipFile zip = new ZipFile())

                 zip.AddDirectory(directoryToZip, "");
                 zip.UseZip64WhenSaving = Zip64Option.Always;
                 zip.BufferSize = 65536*8; // 65536 * 8 = 512k
                 zip.Save(ZipFileToCreate);

               Setting this affects the performance and memory efficiency of compression

               improve performance, but the exact numbers vary depending on available

        <para>
               Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare specification with
               respect to UTF-8 encoding can contain entries with filenames containing
               any combination of Unicode characters, including the full range of
               characters from Chinese, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, and many other
               alphabets.  However, because at this time, the UTF-8 portion of the PKWare
               specification is not broadly supported by other zip libraries and
               utilities, such zip files may not be readable by your favorite zip tool or
               archiver. In other words, interoperability will decrease if you set this

             </para>
        <para>
               In particular, Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare
               specification with respect to UTF-8 encoding will not work well with
               Explorer in Windows XP or Windows Vista, because Windows compressed
               folders, as far as I know, do not support UTF-8 in zip files.  Vista can
               read the zip files, but shows the filenames incorrectly. Unpacking from
               Windows Vista Explorer will result in filenames that have rubbish
               characters in place of the high-order UTF-8 bytes.
             </para>
        <para>
               Also, zip files that use UTF-8 encoding will not work well with Java
               applications that use the java.util.zip classes, as of v5.0 of the Java
               runtime. The Java runtime does not correctly implement the PKWare
               specification in this regard.
             </para>
        <para>
               As a result, we have the unfortunate situation that "correct" behavior by
               the DotNetZip library with regard to Unicode encoding of filenames during
               zip creation will result in zip files that are readable by strictly
               compliant and current tools (for example the most recent release of the
               commercial WinZip tool); but these zip files will not be readable by
               various other tools or libraries, including Windows Explorer.
             </para>
        <para>
               The DotNetZip library can read and write zip files with UTF8-encoded
               entries, according to the PKware spec.  If you use DotNetZip for both
               creating and reading the zip file, and you use UTF-8, there will be no
               loss of information in the filenames. For example, using a self-extractor
               created by this library will allow you to unpack files correctly with no
               loss of information in the filenames.
             </para>
        <para>
               If you do not set this flag, it will remain false.  If this flag is false,
               your <c>ZipFile</c> will encode all filenames and comments using the
               IBM437 codepage.  This can cause "loss of information" on some filenames,
               but the resulting zipfile will be more interoperable with other
               utilities. As an example of the loss of information, diacritics can be
               lost.  The o-tilde character will be down-coded to plain o.  The c with a
               cedilla (Unicode 0xE7) used in Portugese will be downcoded to a c.
               Likewise, the O-stroke character (Unicode 248), used in Danish and
               Norwegian, will be down-coded to plain o. Chinese characters cannot be
               represented in codepage IBM437; when using the default encoding, Chinese
               characters in filenames will be represented as ?. These are all examples
               of "information loss".
             </para>
        <para>
               The loss of information associated to the use of the IBM437 encoding is
               inconvenient, and can also lead to runtime errors. For example, using
               IBM437, any sequence of 4 Chinese characters will be encoded as ????.  If
               your application creates a <c>ZipFile</c>, then adds two files, each with
               names of four Chinese characters each, this will result in a duplicate
               filename exception.  In the case where you add a single file with a name
               containing four Chinese characters, calling Extract() on the entry that
               has question marks in the filename will result in an exception, because
               the question mark is not legal for use within filenames on Windows.  These
               are just a few examples of the problems associated to loss of information.
             </para>
        <para>
               This flag is independent of the encoding of the content within the entries
               in the zip file. Think of the zip file as a container - it supports an
               encoding.  Within the container are other "containers" - the file entries
               themselves.  The encoding within those entries is independent of the
               encoding of the zip archive container for those entries.
             </para>
        <para>
               Rather than specify the encoding in a binary fashion using this flag, an
               application can specify an arbitrary encoding via the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> property.  Setting the encoding
               explicitly when creating zip archives will result in non-compliant zip
               files that, curiously, are fairly interoperable.  The challenge is, the
               PKWare specification does not provide for a way to specify that an entry
               in a zip archive uses a code page that is neither IBM437 nor UTF-8.
               Therefore if you set the encoding explicitly when creating a zip archive,
               you must take care upon reading the zip archive to use the same code page.
               If you get it wrong, the behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect
               filenames, exceptions, stomach upset, hair loss, and acne.

               or libraries do not follow the specification, and instead encode
               characters using the system default code page.  For example, WinRAR when
               run on a machine in Shanghai may encode filenames with the Big-5 Chinese
               (950) code page.  This behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but

               When using DotNetZip to write zip archives that will be read by one of

               is used where possible, in other words, where no loss of data would
               result. It is possible, therefore, to have a given entry with a

               specified "provisional" codepage.

               archivers are non-compliant and can read zip files created in arbitrary
               code pages.  The trick is to use or specify the proper codepage when

               When creating a zip archive using this library, it is possible to change
               the value of <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> between each
               entry you add, and between adding entries and the call to
               <c>Save()</c>. Don't do this. It will likely result in a zipfile that is
               not readable.  For best interoperability, either leave <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> alone, or specify it only once,
               before adding any entries to the <c>ZipFile</c> instance.  There is one
               exception to this recommendation, described later.
             </para>
        <para>
               When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no
               standard way for the creator application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip,
               WinRar, or something else - to formally specify in the zip file which
               codepage has been used for the entries. As a result, readers of zip files
               are not able to inspect the zip file and determine the codepage that was
               used for the entries contained within it.  It is left to the application
               or user to determine the necessary codepage when reading zip files encoded
               this way.  In other words, if you explicitly specify the codepage when you
               create the zipfile, you must explicitly specify the same codepage when
               reading the zipfile.
             </para>
        <para>
               The way you specify the code page to use when reading a zip file varies
               depending on the tool or library you use to read the zip.  In DotNetZip,
               you use a ZipFile.Read() method that accepts an encoding parameter.  It
               isn't possible with Windows Explorer, as far as I know, to specify an
               explicit codepage to use when reading a zip.  If you use an incorrect
               codepage when reading a zipfile, you will get entries with filenames that
               are incorrect, and the incorrect filenames may even contain characters
               that are not legal for use within filenames in Windows. Extracting entries
               with illegal characters in the filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too
               bad, but this is just the way things are with code pages in zip
               files. Caveat Emptor.
             </para>
        <para>
               Example: Suppose you create a zipfile that contains entries with
               filenames that have Danish characters.  If you use <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> equal to "iso-8859-1" (cp 28591),
               the filenames will be correctly encoded in the zip.  But, to read that
               zipfile correctly, you have to specify the same codepage at the time you
               read it. If try to read that zip file with Windows Explorer or another
               application that is not flexible with respect to the codepage used to
               decode filenames in zipfiles, you will get a filename like "Inf°.txt".
             </para>
        <para>
               When using DotNetZip to read a zip archive, and the zip archive uses an
               arbitrary code page, you must specify the encoding to use before or when
               the <c>Zipfile</c> is READ.  This means you must use a <c>ZipFile.Read()</c>
               method that allows you to specify a System.Text.Encoding parameter.  Setting
               the ProvisionalAlternateEncoding property after your application has read in
               the zip archive will not affect the entry names of entries that have already
               been read in.
             </para>
        <para>
               And now, the exception to the rule described above.  One strategy for
               specifying the code page for a given zip file is to describe the code page
               in a human-readable form in the Zip comment. For example, the comment may
               read "Entries in this archive are encoded in the Big5 code page".  For
               maximum interoperability, the zip comment in this case should be encoded
               in the default, IBM437 code page.  In this case, the zip comment is
               encoded using a different page than the filenames.  To do this, Specify
               <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to your desired region-specific code
               page, once before adding any entries, and then reset
               <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to IBM437 before setting the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Comment" /> property and calling Save().

      <example>
             This example shows how to read a zip file using the Big-5 Chinese code page
             (950), and extract each entry in the zip file.  For this code to work as
             desired, the <c>Zipfile</c> must have been created using the big5 code page
             (CP950). This is typical, for example, when using WinRar on a machine with
             CP950 set as the default code page.  In that case, the names of entries
             within the Zip archive will be stored in that code page, and reading the zip
             archive must be done using that code page.  If the application did not use
             the correct code page in <c>ZipFile.Read()</c>, then names of entries within the
             zip archive would not be correctly retrieved.

               <c>AddDirectory</c>, <c>AddEntry</c>, or <c>AddItem</c> methods, etc.
               When reading a zip archive, this property applies to any entry
               subsequently extracted from the <c>ZipFile</c> using one of the Extract
               methods on the <c>ZipFile</c> class.
             </para>
        <para>
               When writing a zip archive, keep this in mind: though the password is set
               on the ZipFile object, according to the Zip spec, the "directory" of the
               archive - in other words the list of entries or files contained in the archive - is
               not encrypted with the password, or protected in any way.  If you set the
               Password property, the password actually applies to individual entries
               that are added to the archive, subsequent to the setting of this property.
               The list of filenames in the archive that is eventually created will
               appear in clear text, but the contents of the individual files are
               encrypted.  This is how Zip encryption works.
             </para>
        <para>
               One simple way around this limitation is to simply double-wrap sensitive
               filenames: Store the files in a zip file, and then store that zip file
               within a second, "outer" zip file.  If you apply a password to the outer
               zip file, then readers will be able to see that the outer zip file
               contains an inner zip file.  But readers will not be able to read the
               directory or file list of the inner zip file.
             </para>
        <para>
               If you set the password on the <c>ZipFile</c>, and then add a set of files
               to the archive, then each entry is encrypted with that password.  You may
               also want to change the password between adding different entries. If you
               set the password, add an entry, then set the password to <c>null</c>
               (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), and add another entry, the first entry is
               encrypted and the second is not.  If you call <c>AddFile()</c>, then set
               the <c>Password</c> property, then call <c>ZipFile.Save</c>, the file
               added will not be password-protected, and no warning will be generated.
             </para>
        <para>
               When setting the Password, you may also want to explicitly set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Encryption" /> property, to specify how to encrypt the entries added
               to the ZipFile.  If you set the Password to a non-null value and do not
               set <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Encryption" />, then PKZip 2.0 ("Weak") encryption is used.
               This encryption is relatively weak but is very interoperable. If you set
               the password to a <c>null</c> value (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), Encryption is
               reset to None.
             </para>
        <para>
               All of the preceding applies to writing zip archives, in other words when
               you use one of the Save methods.  To use this property when reading or an
               existing ZipFile, do the following: set the Password property on the
               <c>ZipFile</c>, then call one of the Extract() overloads on the <see cref="T:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry" />. In this case, the entry is extracted using the
               <c>Password</c> that is specified on the <c>ZipFile</c> instance. If you
               have not set the <c>Password</c> property, then the password is
               <c>null</c>, and the entry is extracted with no password.
             </para>
        <para>
               If you set the Password property on the <c>ZipFile</c>, then call
               <c>Extract()</c> an entry that has not been encrypted with a password, the
               password is not used for that entry, and the <c>ZipEntry</c> is extracted
               as normal. In other words, the password is used only if necessary.
             </para>
        <para>
               The <see cref="T:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry" /> class also has a <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Password">Password</see> property.  It takes precedence
               over this property on the <c>ZipFile</c>.  Typically, you would use the
               per-entry Password when most entries in the zip archive use one password,
               and a few entries use a different password.  If all entries in the zip
               file use the same password, then it is simpler to just set this property
               on the <c>ZipFile</c> itself, whether creating a zip archive or extracting
               a zip archive.

               A callback that allows the application to specify the compression level
               to use for entries subsequently added to the zip archive.

      <remarks>
        <para>
               With this callback, the DotNetZip library allows the application to
               determine whether compression will be used, at the time of the <c>Save</c>. This
               may be useful if the application wants to favor speed over size, and wants
               to defer the decision until the time of <c>Save</c>.
             </para>
        <para>
               Typically applications set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.CompressionLevel" /> property on
               the <c>ZipFile</c> or on each <c>ZipEntry</c> to determine the level of
               compression used. This is done at the time the entry is added to the
               <c>ZipFile</c>. Setting the property to
               <c>Ionic.Zlib.CompressionLevel.None</c> means no compression will be used.
             </para>
        <para>
               This callback allows the application to defer the decision on the
               <c>CompressionLevel</c> to use, until the time of the call to
               <c>ZipFile.Save()</c>. The callback is invoked once per <c>ZipEntry</c>,
               at the time the data for the entry is being written out as part of a
               <c>Save()</c> operation. The application can use whatever criteria it
               likes in determining the level to return.  For example, an application may
               wish that no .mp3 files should be compressed, because they are already
               compressed and the extra compression is not worth the CPU time incurred,
               and so can return <c>None</c> for all .mp3 entries.
             </para>
        <para>
               The library determines whether compression will be attempted for an entry
               this way: If the entry is a zero length file, or a directory, no
               compression is used.  Otherwise, if this callback is set, it is invoked
               and the <c>CompressionLevel</c> is set to the return value. If this
               callback has not been set, then the previously set value for
               <c>CompressionLevel</c> is used.

                 Set this to a non-zero value before calling <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save" /> or <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Save(System.String)" /> to specify that the ZipFile should be saved as a
                 split archive, also sometimes called a spanned archive. Some also

                 A split zip archive is saved in a set of discrete filesystem files,
                 rather than in a single file. This is handy when transmitting the
                 archive in email or some other mechanism that has file size limits.  The
                 first file in a split archive will be named <c>basename.z01</c>, the
                 second will be named <c>basename.z02</c>, and so on. The final file is
                 named <c>basename.zip</c>.
               </para>
        <para>
                 The value of this property determines the maximum size of a split
                 segment when writing a split archive.  According to the zip
                 specification from PKWare, the minimum value is 65536, for a 64k segment
                 size.  For example, suppose you have a <c>ZipFile</c> that would save to
                 a single file of 200k. If you set the <c>MaxOutputSegmentSize</c> to
                 65536 before calling <c>Save()</c>, you will get four distinct output
                 files. On the other hand if you set this property to 256k, then you will
                 get a single-file archive for that <c>ZipFile</c>.
               </para>
        <para>
                 The size of each split output file will often but not always be exactly
                 the maximum size set here. The zip specification requires that some data
                 fields in a zip archive may not span a split boundary. An output segment
                 may be not completely filled if necessary to avoid that problem. Also,
                 obviously the final segment of the archive may be smaller than the
                 maximum segment size.  Segments will never be larger than the value set
                 with this property.

                 You can save a split Zip file only when saving to a regular filesystem

                 archive, nor is it possible to save a split zip file to a stream. When

      <remarks>
        <para>
                 DotNetZip will use multiple threads to compress any ZipEntry,
                 if the entry is larger than the given size.  Zero means "always

                 deflate". The default value for this property is 512k. Aside
                 from the special values of 0 and 1, the minimum value is 65536.
               </para>
        <para>
                 If the entry size cannot be known before compression, as with a
                 read-forward stream, then Parallel deflate will never be
                 performed, unless the value of this property is zero.
               </para>
        <para>
                 A parallel deflate operations will speed up the compression of
                 large files, on computers with multiple CPUs or multiple CPU
                 cores.  For files above 1mb, on a dual core or dual-cpu (2p)
                 machine, the time required to compress the file can be 70% of the
                 single-threaded deflate.  For very large files on 4p machines the
                 compression can be done in 30% of the normal time.  The downside
                 is that parallel deflate consumes extra memory during the deflate,
                 and the deflation is not as effective.
               </para>
        <para>
                 Parallel deflate tends to not be as effective as single-threaded deflate
                 because the original data stream is split into multiple independent
                 buffers, each of which is compressed in parallel.  But because they are
                 treated independently, there is no opportunity to share compression
                 dictionaries.  For that reason, a deflated stream may be slightly larger
                 when compressed using parallel deflate, as compared to a traditional
                 single-threaded deflate. Sometimes the increase over the normal deflate
                 is as much as 5% of the total compressed size. For larger files it can
                 be as small as 0.1%.
               </para>
        <para>
                 Multi-threaded compression does not give as much an advantage when using
                 Encryption. This is primarily because encryption tends to slow down
                 the entire pipeline. Also, multi-threaded compression gives less of an
                 advantage when using lower compression levels, for example <see cref="F:Ionic.Zlib.CompressionLevel.BestSpeed" />.  You may have to perform
                 some tests to determine the best approach for your situation.

             An event that is raised when an error occurs during open or read of files

      <remarks>
        <para>
                 Errors can occur as a file is being saved to the zip archive.  For
                 example, the File.Open may fail, or a File.Read may fail, because of
                 lock conflicts or other reasons.  If you add a handler to this event,
                 you can handle such errors in your own code.  If you don't add a
                 handler, the library will throw an exception if it encounters an I/O
                 error during a call to <c>Save()</c>.
              </para>
        <para>
                Setting a handler implicitly sets <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ZipErrorAction" /> to
                <c>ZipErrorAction.InvokeErrorEvent</c>.
              </para>
        <para>
                The handler you add applies to all <see cref="T:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry" /> items that are
                subsequently added to the <c>ZipFile</c> instance. If you set this
                property after you have added items to the <c>ZipFile</c>, but before you
                have called <c>Save()</c>, errors that occur while saving those items
                will not cause the error handler to be invoked.
              </para>
        <para>
                If you want to handle any errors that occur with any entry in the zip
                file using the same error handler, then add your error handler once,
                before adding any entries to the zip archive.
              </para>
        <para>
                In the error handler method, you need to set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.ZipErrorAction" /> property on the
                <c>ZipErrorEventArgs.CurrentEntry</c>.  This communicates back to
                DotNetZip what you would like to do with this particular error.  Within
                an error handler, if you set the <c>ZipEntry.ZipErrorAction</c> property
                on the <c>ZipEntry</c> to <c>ZipErrorAction.InvokeErrorEvent</c> or if
                you don't set it at all, the library will throw the exception. (It is the
                same as if you had set the <c>ZipEntry.ZipErrorAction</c> property on the
                <c>ZipEntry</c> to <c>ZipErrorAction.Throw</c>.) If you set the
                <c>ZipErrorEventArgs.Cancel</c> to true, the entire <c>Save()</c> will be
                canceled.

               If the flavor of the SFX is <c>SelfExtractorFlavor.ConsoleApplication</c>,
               then the SFX starts a new process, using this string as the post-extract
               command line.  The SFX waits for the process to exit.  The exit code of
               the post-extract command line is returned as the exit code of the
               command-line self-extractor exe. A non-zero exit code is typically used to
               indicated a failure by the program. In the case of an SFX, a non-zero exit
               code may indicate a failure during extraction, OR, it may indicate a
               failure of the run-after-extract program if specified, OR, it may indicate
               the run-after-extract program could not be fuond. There is no way to
               distinguish these conditions from the calling shell, aside from parsing
               the output of the SFX. If you have Quiet set to <c>true</c>, you may not

               extract directory as the working directory for the process. The SFX does
               not wait for the command to complete, and does not check the exit code of
               the program. If the run-after-extract program cannot be fuond, a message

               Some designs require a writable stream for output.  This stream can be used to

               Both the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class and the <c>ZipFile</c> class can be used
               to create zip files. Both of them support many of the common zip features,
               including Unicode, different compression levels, and ZIP64.  For example, when
               creating a zip file via calls to the <c>PutNextEntry()</c> and <c>Write()</c>
               methods on the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> class, the caller is responsible for
               opening the file, reading the bytes from the file, writing those bytes into
               the <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, setting the attributes on the <c>ZipEntry</c>, and
               setting the created, last modified, and last accessed timestamps on the zip
               entry. All of these things are done automatically by a call to <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddFile(System.String,System.String)">ZipFile.AddFile()</see>.  For this
               reason, the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> is generally recommended for when your
               application wants to emit the arbitrary data, not necessarily data from a
               filesystem file, directly into a zip file.

               The <see cref="T:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile" /> class is generally easier to use when creating
               zip files. The ZipOutputStream offers a different metaphor for creating a

        <para>
               On the desktop .NET Framework, DotNetZip can use a multi-threaded
               compression implementation that provides significant speed increases on
               large files, over 300k or so, at the cost of increased memory use at
               runtime.  (The output of the compression is almost exactly the same size).
               But, the multi-threaded approach incurs a performance hit on smaller
               files. There's no way for the ZipOutputStream to know whether parallel
               compression will be beneficial, because the ZipOutputStream does not know
               how much data you will write through the stream.  you may wish to set the
               <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipOutputStream.ParallelDeflateThreshold" /> property to zero, if you are
               compressing large files through <c>ZipOutputStream</c>.  This will cause
               parallel compression to be used, always.

      <remarks>
        <para>
               When writing a zip archive, this password is applied to the entries, not
               to the zip archive itself. It applies to any <c>ZipEntry</c> subsequently
               written to the <c>ZipOutputStream</c>.
             </para>
        <para>
               Using a password does not encrypt or protect the "directory" of the
               archive - the list of entries contained in the archive.  If you set the
               <c>Password</c> property, the password actually applies to individual
               entries that are added to the archive, subsequent to the setting of this
               property.  The list of filenames in the archive that is eventually created
               will appear in clear text, but the contents of the individual files are
               encrypted.  This is how Zip encryption works.
             </para>
        <para>
               If you set this property, and then add a set of entries to the archive via
               calls to <c>PutNextEntry</c>, then each entry is encrypted with that
               password.  You may also want to change the password between adding
               different entries. If you set the password, add an entry, then set the
               password to <c>null</c> (<c>Nothing</c> in VB), and add another entry, the
               first entry is encrypted and the second is not.
             </para>
        <para>
               When setting the <c>Password</c>, you may also want to explicitly set the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipOutputStream.Encryption" /> property, to specify how to encrypt the entries added
               to the ZipFile.  If you set the <c>Password</c> to a non-null value and do not
               set <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipOutputStream.Encryption" />, then PKZip 2.0 ("Weak") encryption is used.
               This encryption is relatively weak but is very interoperable. If
               you set the password to a <c>null</c> value (<c>Nothing</c> in VB),
               <c>Encryption</c> is reset to None.
             </para>
        <para>
               Special case: if you wrap a ZipOutputStream around a non-seekable stream,
               and use encryption, and emit an entry of zero bytes, the <c>Close()</c> or
               <c>PutNextEntry()</c> following the entry will throw an exception.

               the encoding according to that specification.  By default, this flag is
               false, and filenames and comments are encoded into the zip file in the

        <para>
               Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare specification with
               respect to UTF-8 encoding can contain entries with filenames containing
               any combination of Unicode characters, including the full range of
               characters from Chinese, Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, and many other
               alphabets.  However, because at this time, the UTF-8 portion of the PKWare
               specification is not broadly supported by other zip libraries and
               utilities, such zip files may not be readable by your favorite zip tool or
               archiver. In other words, interoperability will decrease if you set this

             </para>
        <para>
               In particular, Zip files created with strict adherence to the PKWare
               specification with respect to UTF-8 encoding will not work well with
               Explorer in Windows XP or Windows Vista, because Windows compressed
               folders, as far as I know, do not support UTF-8 in zip files.  Vista can
               read the zip files, but shows the filenames incorrectly. Unpacking from
               Windows Vista Explorer will result in filenames that have rubbish
               characters in place of the high-order UTF-8 bytes.
             </para>
        <para>
               Also, zip files that use UTF-8 encoding will not work well with Java
               applications that use the java.util.zip classes, as of v5.0 of the Java
               runtime. The Java runtime does not correctly implement the PKWare
               specification in this regard.
             </para>
        <para>
               As a result, we have the unfortunate situation that "correct" behavior by
               the DotNetZip library with regard to Unicode encoding of filenames during
               zip creation will result in zip files that are readable by strictly
               compliant and current tools (for example the most recent release of the
               commercial WinZip tool); but these zip files will not be readable by
               various other tools or libraries, including Windows Explorer.
             </para>
        <para>
               The DotNetZip library can read and write zip files with UTF8-encoded
               entries, according to the PKware spec.  If you use DotNetZip for both
               creating and reading the zip file, and you use UTF-8, there will be no
               loss of information in the filenames. For example, using a self-extractor
               created by this library will allow you to unpack files correctly with no
               loss of information in the filenames.
             </para>
        <para>
               If you do not set this flag, it will remain false.  If this flag is false,
               the <c>ZipOutputStream</c> will encode all filenames and comments using
               the IBM437 codepage.  This can cause "loss of information" on some
               filenames, but the resulting zipfile will be more interoperable with other
               utilities. As an example of the loss of information, diacritics can be
               lost.  The o-tilde character will be down-coded to plain o.  The c with a
               cedilla (Unicode 0xE7) used in Portugese will be downcoded to a c.
               Likewise, the O-stroke character (Unicode 248), used in Danish and
               Norwegian, will be down-coded to plain o. Chinese characters cannot be
               represented in codepage IBM437; when using the default encoding, Chinese
               characters in filenames will be represented as ?. These are all examples
               of "information loss".
             </para>
        <para>
               The loss of information associated to the use of the IBM437 encoding is
               inconvenient, and can also lead to runtime errors. For example, using
               IBM437, any sequence of 4 Chinese characters will be encoded as ????.  If
               your application creates a <c>ZipOutputStream</c>, does not set the
               encoding, then adds two files, each with names of four Chinese characters
               each, this will result in a duplicate filename exception.  In the case
               where you add a single file with a name containing four Chinese
               characters, the zipfile will save properly, but extracting that file
               later, with any zip tool, will result in an error, because the question
               mark is not legal for use within filenames on Windows.  These are just a
               few examples of the problems associated to loss of information.
             </para>
        <para>
               This flag is independent of the encoding of the content within the entries
               in the zip file. Think of the zip file as a container - it supports an
               encoding.  Within the container are other "containers" - the file entries
               themselves.  The encoding within those entries is independent of the
               encoding of the zip archive container for those entries.
             </para>
        <para>
               Rather than specify the encoding in a binary fashion using this flag, an
               application can specify an arbitrary encoding via the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipOutputStream.ProvisionalAlternateEncoding" /> property.  Setting the encoding
               explicitly when creating zip archives will result in non-compliant zip
               files that, curiously, are fairly interoperable.  The challenge is, the
               PKWare specification does not provide for a way to specify that an entry
               in a zip archive uses a code page that is neither IBM437 nor UTF-8.
               Therefore if you set the encoding explicitly when creating a zip archive,
               you must take care upon reading the zip archive to use the same code page.
               If you get it wrong, the behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect
               filenames, exceptions, stomach upset, hair loss, and acne.

               When using an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there is no
               standard way for the creator application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip,
               WinRar, or something else - to formally specify in the zip file which
               codepage has been used for the entries. As a result, readers of zip files
               are not able to inspect the zip file and determine the codepage that was
               used for the entries contained within it.  It is left to the application
               or user to determine the necessary codepage when reading zip files encoded
               this way.  If you use an incorrect codepage when reading a zipfile, you
               will get entries with filenames that are incorrect, and the incorrect
               filenames may even contain characters that are not legal for use within
               filenames in Windows. Extracting entries with illegal characters in the
               filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too bad, but this is just the way

        <para>
               One possible approach for specifying the code page for a given zip file is
               to describe the code page in a human-readable form in the Zip comment. For
               example, the comment may read "Entries in this archive are encoded in the
               Big5 code page".  For maximum interoperability, the zip comment in this
               case should be encoded in the default, IBM437 code page.  In this case,
               the zip comment is encoded using a different page than the filenames.  To
               do this, Specify <c>ProvisionalAlternateEncoding</c> to your desired
               region-specific code page, once before adding any entries, and then set

                 performed, unless the value of this property is zero.
               </para>
        <para>
                 A parallel deflate operations will speed up the compression of
                 large files, on computers with multiple CPUs or multiple CPU
                 cores.  For files above 1mb, on a dual core or dual-cpu (2p)
                 machine, the time required to compress the file can be 70% of the
                 single-threaded deflate.  For very large files on 4p machines the
                 compression can be done in 30% of the normal time.  The downside
                 is that parallel deflate consumes extra memory during the deflate,
                 and the deflation is slightly less effective.
               </para>
        <para>
                 Parallel deflate tends to not be as effective as single-threaded deflate
                 because the original data stream is split into multiple independent
                 buffers, each of which is compressed in parallel.  But because they are
                 treated independently, there is no opportunity to share compression
                 dictionaries, and additional framing bytes must be added to the output
                 stream.  For that reason, a deflated stream may be slightly larger when
                 compressed using parallel deflate, as compared to a traditional
                 single-threaded deflate. For files of about 512k, the increase over the
                 normal deflate is as much as 5% of the total compressed size. For larger
                 files, the difference can be as small as 0.1%.
               </para>
        <para>
                 Multi-threaded compression does not give as much an advantage when using
                 Encryption. This is primarily because encryption tends to slow down
                 the entire pipeline. Also, multi-threaded compression gives less of an
                 advantage when using lower compression levels, for example <see cref="F:Ionic.Zlib.CompressionLevel.BestSpeed" />.  You may have to perform
                 some tests to determine the best approach for your situation.
               </para>
        <para>
                 The default value for this property is -1, which means parallel
                 compression will not be performed unless you set it to zero.

               FileSelector encapsulates logic that selects files from a source - a zip file
               or the filesystem - based on a set of criteria.  This class is used internally
               by the DotNetZip library, in particular for the AddSelectedFiles() methods.
               This class can also be used independently of the zip capability in DotNetZip.

               The FileSelector class is used internally by the ZipFile class for selecting
               files for inclusion into the ZipFile, when the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.AddSelectedFiles(System.String,System.String)" /> method, or one of
               its overloads, is called.  It's also used for the <see cref="M:Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.ExtractSelectedEntries(System.String)" /> methods.  Typically, an
               application that creates or manipulates Zip archives will not directly
               interact with the FileSelector class.

        <para>
               Some applications may wish to use the FileSelector class directly, to

               querying Zip archives.  The file selection criteria include: a pattern to
               match the filename; the last modified, created, or last accessed time of the

             Supported nouns include "name" (or "filename") for the filename; "atime",

             The value for a size criterion is expressed in integer quantities of bytes,

        <para>
             The value for a name is a pattern to match against the filename, potentially
             including wildcards.  The pattern follows CMD.exe glob rules: * implies one
             or more of any character, while ?  implies one character.  If the name
             pattern contains any slashes, it is matched to the entire filename,
             including the path; otherwise, it is matched against only the filename
             without the path.  This means a pattern of "*\*.*" matches all files one
             directory level deep, while a pattern of "*.*" matches all files in all
             directories.
             </para>
        <para>
             To specify a name pattern that includes spaces, use single quotes around the
             pattern.  A pattern of "'* *.*'" will match all files that have spaces in
             the filename.  The full criteria string for that would be "name = '* *.*'" .

             You can combine criteria with the conjunctions AND, OR, and XOR. Using a string like
             "name = *.txt AND size &gt;= 100k" for the selectionCriteria retrieves entries whose
             names end in .txt, and whose uncompressed size is greater than or equal to 100
             kilobytes.
             </para>
        <para>
             For more complex combinations of criteria, you can use parenthesis to group clauses
             in the boolean logic.  Absent parenthesis, the precedence of the criterion atoms is
             determined by order of appearance.  Unlike the C# language, the AND conjunction does
             not take precendence over the logical OR.  This is important only in strings that
             contain 3 or more criterion atoms.  In other words, "name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000
             or attributes = H" implies "((name = *.txt AND size &gt; 1000) OR attributes = H)"
             while "attributes = H OR name = *.txt and size &gt; 1000" evaluates to "((attributes
             = H OR name = *.txt) AND size &gt; 1000)".  When in doubt, use parenthesis.
             </para>
        <para>
             Using time properties requires some extra care. If you want to retrieve all entries
             that were last updated on 2009 February 14, specify "mtime &gt;= 2009-02-14 AND
             mtime &lt; 2009-02-15".  Read this to say: all files updated after 12:00am on
             February 14th, until 12:00am on February 15th.  You can use the same bracketing
             approach to specify any time period - a year, a month, a week, and so on.
             </para>
        <para>
             The syntax allows one special case: if you provide a string with no spaces, it is treated as
             a pattern to match for the filename.  Therefore a string like "*.xls" will be equivalent to
             specifying "name = *.xls".  This "shorthand" notation does not work with compound criteria.

             There is no logic in this class that insures that the inclusion criteria
             are internally consistent.  For example, it's possible to specify criteria that
             says the file must have a size of less than 100 bytes, as well as a size that
             is greater than 1000 bytes.  Obviously no file will ever satisfy such criteria,
             but this class does not check for or detect such inconsistencies.

               Options for using ZIP64 extensions when saving zip archives.
             </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>
               Designed many years ago, the <see href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">original zip
               specification from PKWARE</see> allowed for 32-bit quantities for the
               compressed and uncompressed sizes of zip entries, as well as a 32-bit quantity
               for specifying the length of the zip archive itself, and a maximum of 65535
               entries.  These limits are now regularly exceeded in many backup and archival
               scenarios.  Recently, PKWare added extensions to the original zip spec, called
               "ZIP64 extensions", to raise those limitations.  This property governs whether
               DotNetZip will use those extensions when writing zip archives. The use of
               these extensions is optional and explicit in DotNetZip because, despite the
               status of ZIP64 as a bona fide standard, many other zip tools and libraries do
               not support ZIP64, and therefore a zip file with ZIP64 extensions may be
               unreadable by some of those other tools.
             </para>
        <para>
               Set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Always" /> to always use ZIP64
               extensions when saving, regardless of whether your zip archive needs it.
               Suppose you add 5 files, each under 100k, to a ZipFile. If you specify Always
               for this flag, you will get a ZIP64 archive, though the archive does not need
               to use ZIP64 because none of the original zip limits had been exceeded.
             </para>
        <para>
               Set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Never" /> to tell the DotNetZip
               library to never use ZIP64 extensions.  This is useful for maximum
               compatibility and interoperability, at the expense of the capability of
               handling large files or large archives.  NB: Windows Explorer in Windows XP
               and Windows Vista cannot currently extract files from a zip64 archive, so if
               you want to guarantee that a zip archive produced by this library will work in
               Windows Explorer, use <c>Never</c>. If you set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Never" />, and your application creates a zip that would
               exceed one of the Zip limits, the library will throw an exception while saving
               the zip file.
             </para>
        <para>
               Set this property to <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.AsNecessary" /> to tell the
               DotNetZip library to use the ZIP64 extensions when required by the
               entry. After the file is compressed, the original and compressed sizes are
               checked, and if they exceed the limits described above, then zip64 can be
               used. That is the general idea, but there is an additional wrinkle when saving
               to a non-seekable device, like the ASP.NET <c>Response.OutputStream</c>, or
               <c>Console.Out</c>.  When using non-seekable streams for output, the entry
               header - which indicates whether zip64 is in use - is emitted before it is
               known if zip64 is necessary.  It is only after all entries have been saved
               that it can be known if ZIP64 will be required.  On seekable output streams,
               after saving all entries, the library can seek backward and re-emit the zip
               file header to be consistent with the actual ZIP64 requirement.  But using a
               non-seekable output stream, the library cannot seek backward, so the header
               can never be changed. In other words, the archive's use of ZIP64 extensions is
               not alterable after the header is emitted.  Therefore, when saving to
               non-seekable streams, using <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.AsNecessary" /> is the same
               as using <see cref="F:Ionic.Zip.Zip64Option.Always" />: it will always produce a zip
               archive that uses ZIP64 extensions.

               zip specification</see>, PKWare describes two options for encoding
               filenames and comments: using IBM437 or UTF-8.  But, some archiving tools
               or libraries do not follow the specification, and instead encode
               characters using the system default code page.  For example, WinRAR when
               run on a machine in Shanghai may encode filenames with the Big-5 Chinese
               (950) code page.  This behavior is contrary to the Zip specification, but
               it occurs anyway.
             </para>
        <para>
               When using DotNetZip to read zip archives that use something other than
               UTF-8 or IBM437, set this property to specify the code page to use when
               reading encoded filenames and comments for each <c>ZipEntry</c> in the zip
               file.
             </para>
        <para>
               This property is "provisional". When the entry in the zip archive is not
               explicitly marked as using UTF-8, then IBM437 is used to decode filenames
               and comments. If a loss of data would result from using IBM436 -
               specifically when encoding and decoding is not reflexive - the codepage
               specified here is used. It is possible, therefore, to have a given entry
               with a <c>Comment</c> encoded in IBM437 and a <c>FileName</c> encoded with
               the specified "provisional" codepage.
             </para>
        <para>
               When a zip file uses an arbitrary, non-UTF8 code page for encoding, there
               is no standard way for the reader application - whether DotNetZip, WinZip,
               WinRar, or something else - to know which codepage has been used for the
               entries. Readers of zip files are not able to inspect the zip file and
               determine the codepage that was used for the entries contained within it.
               It is left to the application or user to determine the necessary codepage
               when reading zip files encoded this way.  If you use an incorrect codepage
               when reading a zipfile, you will get entries with filenames that are
               incorrect, and the incorrect filenames may even contain characters that
               are not legal for use within filenames in Windows. Extracting entries with
               illegal characters in the filenames will lead to exceptions. It's too bad,
               but this is just the way things are with code pages in zip files. Caveat
               Emptor.

               WinZip. If you want to produce interoperable Zip archives, do not use these
               values.  For example, if you produce a zip archive using WinZipAes256, you
               will be able to open it in Windows Explorer on Windows XP and Vista, but you
               will not be able to extract entries; trying this will lead to an "unspecified
               error". For this reason, some people have said that a zip archive that uses
               WinZip's AES encryption is not actually a zip archive at all.  A zip archive
               produced this way will be readable with the WinZip tool (Version 11 and

               actual AES key used is derived from the <see cref="P:Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry.Password" /> via an
               algorithm that complies with <see href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt">RFC 2898</see>, using an iteration
               count of 1000.  The algorithm is sometimes referred to as PBKDF2, which stands

               A word about password strength and length: The AES encryption technology is
               very good, but any system is only as secure as the weakest link.  If you want
               to secure your data, be sure to use a password that is hard to guess.  To make
               it harder to guess (increase its "entropy"), you should make it longer.  If
               you use normal characters from an ASCII keyboard, a password of length 20 will
               be strong enough that it will be impossible to guess.  For more information on
               that, I'd encourage you to read <see href="http://www.redkestrel.co.uk/Articles/RandomPasswordStrength.html">this

               The WinZip AES algorithms are not supported with the version of DotNetZip that

            This class implements the "traditional" or "classic" PKZip encryption,

            Most uses of the DotNetZip library will not involve direct calls into the

            the ZipEntry() class when encryption or decryption on an entry is employed.
            If for some reason you really wanted to use a weak encryption algorithm
            in some other application, you might use this library.  But you would be much
            better off using one of the built-in strong encryption libraries in the 
            .NET Framework, like the AES algorithm or SHA.

               This class is similar to <see cref="T:Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream" />, except
               that this implementation uses an approach that employs multiple worker
               threads to perform the DEFLATE.  On a multi-cpu or multi-core computer,
               the performance of this class can be significantly higher than the
               single-threaded DeflateStream, particularly for larger streams.  How
               large?  Anything over 10mb is a good candidate for parallel compression.
             </para>
        <para>
               The tradeoff is that this class uses more memory and more CPU than the
               vanilla DeflateStream, and also is less efficient as a compressor. For
               large files the size of the compressed data stream can be less than 1%
               larger than the size of a compressed data stream from the vanialla
               DeflateStream.  For smaller files the difference can be larger.  The
               difference will also be larger if you set the BufferSize to be lower
               than the default value.  Your mileage may vary. Finally, for small
               files, the ParallelDeflateOutputStream can be much slower than the vanilla
               DeflateStream, because of the overhead of using the thread pool.

               This property sets the number of memory buffers to create, for every

               will call Write().  There will be multiple background threads that
               then compress (DEFLATE) the data written into the stream, and also a
               single output thread, also operating in the background, aggregating

               Larger buffer sizes implies larger memory consumption but allows
               more efficient compression. Using smaller buffer sizes consumes less
               memory but result in less effective compression.  For example, using
               the default buffer size of 128k, the compression delivered is within
               1% of the compression delivered by the single-threaded <see cref="T:Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream" />.  On the other hand, using a
               BufferSize of 8k can result in a compressed data stream that is 5%
               larger than that delivered by the single-threaded
               <c>DeflateStream</c>.  Excessively small buffer sizes can also cause
               the speed of the ParallelDeflateOutputStream to drop, because of
               larger thread scheduling overhead dealing with many many small
               buffers.

               If you wish to use the <c>GZipStream</c> to compress data, you must wrap it
               around a write-able stream. As you call <c>Write()</c> on the <c>GZipStream</c>, the
               data will be compressed into the GZIP format.  If you want to decompress data,
               you must wrap the <c>GZipStream</c> around a readable stream that contains an
               IETF RFC 1952-compliant stream.  The data will be decompressed as you call
               <c>Read()</c> on the <c>GZipStream</c>.
             </para>
        <para>
               Though the GZIP format allows data from multiple files to be concatenated
               together, this stream handles only a single segment of GZIP format, typically
               representing a single file.

               GZIP allows the storage of a last modified time with each GZIP entry.

             The ZlibStream is a <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorator</see> on a <see cref="T:System.IO.Stream" />.  It adds ZLIB compression or decompression to any

        <para> Using this stream, applications can compress or decompress data via
             stream <c>Read()</c> and <c>Write()</c> operations.  Either compresssion or
             decompression can occur through either reading or writing. The compression
             format used is ZLIB, which is documented in <see href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt">IETF RFC 1950</see>, "ZLIB Compressed
             Data Format Specification version 3.3". This implementation of ZLIB always uses
             DEFLATE as the compression method.  (see <see href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt">IETF RFC 1951</see>, "DEFLATE
             Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3.") </para>
        <para>
             The ZLIB format allows for varying compression methods, window sizes, and dictionaries.

            setting alone if you don't know what it is.  The maximum value is 15 bits, which implies

      <remarks>
            This is only effective in compression.  The theory offered by ZLIB is that different
            strategies could potentially produce significant differences in compression behavior
            for different data sets.  Unfortunately I don't have any good recommendations for how
            to set it differently.  When I tested changing the strategy I got minimally different
            compression performance. It's best to leave this property alone if you don't have a
            good feel for it.  Or, you may want to produce a test harness that runs through the
            different strategy options and evaluates them on different file types. If you do that,
            let me know your results.
